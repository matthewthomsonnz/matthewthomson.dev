# Traditional project management (Waterfall) is often broken and inefficient
 Sutherland argues that conventional, sequential approaches to project management frequently lead to delays, budget overruns, and ultimately, failed projects, citing examples like the FBI's Virtual Case File.

# Scrum is rooted in empiricism transparency, inspection, and adaptation
 Instead of detailed upfront planning, Scrum relies on continuous feedback and adjustment. Work is made visible (transparency), progress is regularly checked (inspection), and changes are made as needed (adaptation).


# Small, cross-functional, self-organizing teams are key
 Effective Scrum teams are typically small (3-9 people), have all the necessary skills to deliver a working increment, and are empowered to decide how best to accomplish their work without micromanagement.

# Timeboxing is crucial for focus and predictability
 Work is broken down into short, fixed-length "Sprints" (typically 1-4 weeks). This forces prioritization, limits work-in-progress, and provides regular opportunities for inspection and adaptation.

# Deliver working software (or a usable increment) frequently
 The goal of each Sprint is to produce a "Done" increment of product that is potentially releasable. This ensures continuous value delivery and allows for early feedback.

# Prioritize ruthlessly based on value and risk
 The Product Owner is responsible for maintaining a prioritized "Product Backlog," ensuring that the most valuable and least risky items are tackled first.

# Eliminate waste in all its forms
 Inspired by Lean principles, Scrum actively seeks to identify and remove anything that doesn't add value, including unnecessary meetings, handoffs, multitasking, and unfinished work.

# Daily Scrums (stand-ups) foster communication and problem-solving
 Short, daily meetings help the team synchronize efforts, identify impediments, and adjust their plan for the next 24 hours.

# Retrospectives drive continuous improvement
 At the end of each Sprint, the team reflects on what went well, what could be improved, and creates actionable plans to enhance their process for the next Sprint.

# Focus on flow and happiness for productivity
 By removing impediments, fostering collaboration, and delivering tangible results, Scrum aims to create a state of "flow" for the team, leading to higher productivity and greater job satisfaction.
