Scenario 1 - Albums feature

Your task is to create a grid of thumbnails, how would you go about deciding what size the thumbnails should be

difference for desktop vs mobile

Looking at similar products

Looking at file sizes

Looking at standard screen sizes etc

How would you handle implementing a “select all” feature knowing that there could be thousands of items being selected and the API will return paginated results as well as telling you the total number of items

What kind of file-upload methods would you want to implement in the UI

Browse button

Drag and drop anywhere on the page

Drag and drop zone

Mobile-specific browse/take-photo button

Provide URL(s) to download from

Browse from 3rd party service (google drive/photos etc)


Scenario 2 - Invoices

How would you deal with multiple line items, adding/deleting/editing etc.

How would you structure your code for complex calculations, like calculating sub totals + sales tax for all the lines (where would the code fit etc)


Scenario 3 - Notes component

A new create/list/update API has been developed for managing Notes and their attachments. You are tasked with the UI.

You find an existing notes UI component, but the API data structure it's built for is similar but too different and it doesn’t support attachments

You find some Javascript needed for note attachment upload handling in a different component.

What is your plan for building this UI feature?


Scenario 4 - form

You are developing a form component/module.

You find a UI component that is unnecessarily large (800 lines long), but about half the html in this component is identical to what you need for your form. You also want the validation logic from it.


How would you approach building your form?


NPM

What would you look for when picking a 3rd party package to use
