{/* - Confirmation modal */}
{/*   - should confirm on enter */}
{/*   - should exit and cancel on escape */}

{/* - Input Modal */}
{/*   - takes an array of field types */}
{/*     - e.g. FIELD-TYPES.RICH_TEXT_FIELD, */}



{/* - tab header */}

{/* - tiptap rich text field */}

{/* - styled dropdown/select/autocomplete */}
{/*   - should take a prefix that can be text or an icon */}
{/*   - or replace the component entirely with e.g. an initialsBadge */}
{/*   - should be able to pass colours as the selection items ( nice for stages - where the start of the array is red, middle is yellow, end is green) */}
{/*   - bulk select/edit/delete/rename/archive */}




{/* - datepicker and timepicker */}
{/*   - timepicker should mimic the google calendar one - where it takes the next 15 min increment from the current time */}
{/*   - or allows you to enter a custom one */}
{/*   - datepicker should be a text input, that helps you manually enter/autofill a date via datepicker */}
{/*   - should use day.js for developer clarity/verbosity */}

{/* - input data table */}
{/*   - input fields in each of the <> cells */}
{/*   - overrides Vuetifys entire body slot with raw html to improve performance */}

{/* - draggable nested list */}

{/* - filters + data table ( no inputs in table) */}
{/*   - must be easy to set up consistently with a composable */}
{/*     - e.g. pagination/page/perPage */}
{/*     - custom component slots that loop over the headers passed ( can be messy otherwise e.g. if context === something, show this otherwise hide that) */}
