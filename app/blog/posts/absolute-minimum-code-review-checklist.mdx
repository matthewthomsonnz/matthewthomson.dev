Note: the below is centered around Vue

### Vue quirks
 ```
 items.value.push(data) // wont trigger reactivity when using defineModel() or watchers wont fire
 ```




### boolean naming
 https://dev.to/michi/tips-on-naming-boolean-variables-cleaner-code-35ig

### v-for/template loops are keyed

### memory leaks
- event listeners are torn down
- check for global variable shananegans


### booleans
 should be prefixed with `is` `are` `should` etc

### props
 are an exception to the above, they can be `modalOpen` instead of `isModalOpen`
!! list a reference for prop naming

### code of similar concerns
should be grouped together  https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq#more-flexible-code-organization

- JS enums insted of if `someVariable = 2`
  - unrepresentable state logic errors
  - clearer to read
  - only update in one place

### constants
const SHOULD_BE_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

### reusability
- Ensure components are genuinely reusable, and not a copy paste and change slightly
  - makes code unmaintainable long term
  - you dont want three disparate implementations of a file upload component, where you have to manually one day add max file size, max number of items etc
  - no to mention visual consistency leading to lack of familiarity

  ### memoization
  Look for methods being called where computed() can be used. Vue doesnt have template variables leaving it suceptible to a method call in a loop in multiple places

  ### request state/error handling

 - loading state should be set to false under `finally()`
 - buttons should be disabled
 - inputs surface api errors gracefully

 ### verbose function names and comments only when necessary
- Code should be able to be understood at a glance.
- Free from redundant comments

### function/ method names
- should be verbose
- should tell you what they do
- shouldnt do somethhing they dont tell you about
- if from an event, should be prefixed with handle


# logs
- no console logs, warnings, errors

# layout shift
- things shouldnt jus

# clear data flow
- provide/inject should be reserved for well thought out scenarios
- components should be 'dumb'
- components should be structured so its clear how the data is passed between them
