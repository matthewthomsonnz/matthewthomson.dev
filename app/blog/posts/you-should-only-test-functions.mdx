Trigger warning - the purpose of me writing this is to change my mind about this, from my experience this is the only way.

For the front end:
- virtual dom - listening for and redispatching events
- actual headless browser - super heavy
- need test coverage
Selenium, Cypress, Playwright

For the backend:
- End-to-End test,
- feature test
- integration test
- database calls
- checking functions return a view (e.g. html) that contains 'foo'

Leads to slow

You should just stub out any methods it calls and just check they are called x times

I honestly think anyone that does these needs a discussion

you just end up testing things that a few years down the track someone asks 'this is so pointless'.

Ive seen companies where everyone should be developing for the customer, waste so much

Should use Static Analysis Tools (e.g., PHPStan, ESLint)
Code Coverage Tools (e.g., Xdebug):
