Design with tactics, not just talent
 The book emphasizes practical, actionable techniques that developers can use to improve their UI designs without needing to be a natural "designer." It focuses on specific solutions to common design problems.

Prioritize content and functionality over layout
 Start by focusing on what the UI needs to do (the features) rather than getting bogged down in intricate layout decisions. The purpose of the UI should drive its design.

Embrace visual hierarchy: Not all elements are equal
 Use size, weight, color, contrast, and spacing to guide the user's eye and emphasize important information while de-emphasizing less critical elements.

Start with too much whitespace, then reduce
 Begin by giving elements ample breathing room. It's easier to remove excess space than to try and add it when a design feels cramped.

Establish a consistent spacing and sizing system
 Define a base unit for spacing and sizing (e.g., multiples of 4px or 8px) to ensure consistency and speed up your design process.

Use fewer borders; prefer shadows, color, and spacing for separation
 Too many borders can make a design look busy and cluttered. Achieve visual separation using subtle box shadows, contrasting background colors, or simply more whitespace.

Work with color effectively
 Understand how to build a usable color palette, moving beyond just primary and accent colors. Learn to define shades upfront, use HSL for easier color manipulation, and ensure accessibility.

Design in grayscale first, then add color
 By designing in black and white initially, you force yourself to rely on strong visual hierarchy through spacing, contrast, and sizing. Color can then be added as an enhancement.

Treat text as a design element
 Pay attention to typography, including establishing a type scale, choosing good fonts with sufficient weights, maintaining readable line lengths, and aligning text properly (e.g., by baseline).

"Future-proofing" is about continuous iteration and attention to detail
 The book implicitly teaches that good UI isn't a one-time achievement but an ongoing process of refinement. Small adjustments and attention to consistent details make a significant difference.
