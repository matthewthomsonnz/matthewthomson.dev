I have an old 2 liter non-turbo manual impreza I take to the track for fun. I thought it would be fun to install some cheap engine
 management and push the performance to the limit.

 It was an opportunity for me to learn arduino and automotive electrical wiring at the same time.

Challenges and learnings:
- Having to cut the injector wires as the factory ecu applies voltage, whereas Speeduino grounds to trigger spark
- the Subaru 6/7 trigger wheel code is buggy. It would take about 10 seconds of cranking before it would fire
- running both radiator fan relays off a single pin
- Not having a plug and play ecu was annoying, I wanted to be able to plug my factory ecu back in (in case my jerry-rigged ecu just stopped working) but became messy with the wire cutting

I didn't blow up the car in the end, I have now taken the good parts  and scrapped it though (for my  identical but faster version of the same car)
