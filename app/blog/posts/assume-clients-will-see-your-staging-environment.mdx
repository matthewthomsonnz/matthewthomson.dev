Fine:
- Adding really long words, sentences, weird characters to try and break inputs (the UI should handle these)

Not fine
- Adding questionable images, funny words. Instead try to use data that
- just entering firstName: test, lastname 'asdfasdf', email: test@test.com
  - instead firstName: Bob, lastName: Smith, email: bsmith@yourcompany.com

, last name: test, email test@test.
